# Codex Cmux Hook Trust Review

## Summary

Review whether Codex sessions launched through cmux should use
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, and decide what roborepo should do if that behavior remains
outside this repository's direct control.

## Context

A cmux-launched Codex session can prepend `--enable hooks`,
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, and inline `-c hooks.*=...` arguments so cmux lifecycle hooks
run without requiring Codex's persisted hook trust review. That helps automation and session
rebinding, but the bypass flag is invocation-wide: it is not scoped only to cmux-injected hooks.

Roborepo already manages Codex baseline config and generated rules. It also ships Codex hooks for
telemetry, permission checks, bash-output minimization, jcodemunch, and jdocmunch behavior.

## Goals

- Confirm exactly which hook sources Codex loads when the bypass flag is present.
- Determine whether cmux can scope bypass to its own injected hooks or remove bypass after one-time
  review.
- Decide whether roborepo should add a warning, doctor check, portal notice, or documentation note.
- Preserve normal interactive hook review for user, project, package, and plugin hooks.
- Avoid blocking legitimate automation where hook sources are externally pinned or managed.

## Non-goals

- Do not change cmux itself from this repository unless cmux support is intentionally brought into
  scope.
- Do not disable roborepo's own hooks as a workaround.
- Do not treat all dynamic hook injection as unsafe; the concern is unscoped trust bypass.

## Current State

| Area | Current behavior | Concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex baseline | `features.hooks = true` in managed config | Expected; hooks remain reviewable without bypass |
| Roborepo hooks | Generated/global hooks run for telemetry and guardrails | Should stay reviewable or managed |
| cmux launch path | cmux may inject hook config through CLI args | Needs audit for source control and scoping |
| Trust bypass | `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` applies to the whole invocation | User/project/plugin hooks may also skip review |

## Proposed Design

Investigate first, then choose the lightest response:

1. If cmux can remove the bypass while preserving session tracking, prefer that.
2. If cmux needs bypass only for its own hooks, prefer a launch mode that prevents unrelated hook
   sources from loading.
3. If roborepo cannot change runtime behavior, add visibility: a doctor warning or portal notice
   when a live Codex command line contains `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`.
4. Document when bypass is acceptable: non-interactive automation with externally vetted hook
   sources, not ordinary human interactive sessions.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Reproduce a cmux-launched Codex session and capture only the process command line plus active
      Codex hook source list.
- [ ] Inspect Codex docs or CLI behavior to confirm whether bypass applies to all enabled hook
      sources.
- [ ] Identify whether Codex supports disabling user/project/plugin hook discovery while retaining
      inline injected hooks.
- [ ] Decide whether the fix belongs in cmux, roborepo docs, `roborepo doctor`, or the portal.
- [ ] If adding a roborepo warning, keep detection read-only and scoped to live process args or
      explicit config files.

## Validation

- Document the observed hook source list for one cmux-launched Codex session.
- Verify any roborepo warning with a fixture or targeted smoke test.
- Run the smallest native check for touched code or docs.

## Risks

- Process inspection may need local permission escalation on macOS.
- A warning based only on process args can produce false positives for intentional automation.
- Codex hook trust behavior may change across CLI versions, so doc wording should avoid assuming
  stable internals beyond observed behavior.

## Open Questions

- Can cmux inject only managed/pinned hooks so Codex trust review remains meaningful?
- Can cmux launch Codex with inline hooks while excluding user, project, and plugin hook sources?
- Should roborepo surface this as a security warning, a context note, or no warning unless the user
  opts into runtime audits?
