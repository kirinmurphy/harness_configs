// by rewriting; a file set has no records — staleness is per-file mtime, and the commit is unlink
// per file. Same policy vocabulary, same verdict shape, so a caller reads both the same way.
//
// Returns the files to remove rather than a count, because unlike a log's prefix trim, the victims
// here are not contiguous — an old file can sit between two recent ones in readdir order.
