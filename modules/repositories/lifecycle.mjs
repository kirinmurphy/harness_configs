// Repository lifecycle: what state a persisted repository is in right now.
//
// Derived on every scan rather than stored. Two of the three states depend on whether a directory
// is readable *at this moment* — an unplugged drive changes the answer without the record changing
// at all — so persisting them would let the registry assert something that was true when it was
// written and false when it is read. The registry keeps the durable facts (firstSeenAt/lastSeenAt,
// which roots exist); this derives the observation.
//
// The distinction the whole module turns on is between LOOKING AND FINDING NOTHING and NOT BEING
// ABLE TO LOOK. Only the first is evidence a checkout is gone. Treating an unreadable parent as
// absence would mark every repository on an unmounted share as `stale` the moment it is unplugged.

// The repository that now owns every checkout this one used to, or null.

// This is the read side of the rename decision Phase 2 made deliberately: when a checkout resolves
// to a new git identity the checkout REPOINTS and both records survive, because a renamed remote and
// a deleted-then-recloned directory produce identical stored data and a wrong merge hides one
// repository's work inside another. Nothing is merged automatically, and that still holds.
//
// What changed is that the superseded record became visible. While only running repositories were
// listed it never appeared; once persisted repositories render, a record whose every root has been
// repointed shows up as a full idle card beside the record that took its roots — two "roborepo"
// cards, one of which is a former remote nobody is using. deriveLifecycle cannot tell them apart on
// its own, because a fully-repointed record and a never-resolved one both have zero resolvable
// roots and both read as `idle`.
//
// So this reports the successor rather than acting on it — same discipline as priorRepositoryForRoot
// in the other direction. The caller decides whether to fold the card away, and the record itself is
// untouched and recoverable.
//
// Deliberately conservative. Null unless the record HAS roots (a record that never resolved one is
// not superseded, just unresolved), EVERY one of them is now owned by another repository, and they
// all agree on which. A record whose roots scattered across several successors is left alone: that
// is not a rename, and guessing which one wins is the merge this design refuses to make.

//    of unplugging. Ageing on last-seen hides it only if you genuinely stop using it.
//
// 2. A record with no lastSeenAt at all NEVER ages out. "Never seen" is not "seen long ago" — such
//    records exist (registered by a source that never resolved a root), and treating a missing
//    timestamp as infinitely old would hide them all on the first sweep.

// the user explicitly un-hid is not re-hidden behind their back.
